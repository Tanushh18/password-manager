# Stashr — Password Vault & Project Secrets

Stashr is a web and Android application for managing saved logins and project configuration from a shared API. The repository includes a React/Vite web client, an Express API, and an Expo/React Native mobile client.

> **Security scope:** This README describes repository setup and the visible design. It is not a security audit or a guarantee that the deployed service is secure. Do not place real vault data, production tokens, API keys, private keys, database dumps, or password exports in Git.

## Features

- Password and login entry management, folders, favorites, password generation, and vault-health checks.
- Project records for hosting, databases, cloud integrations, environment variables, and custom fields.
- Web client and Android client using the same API.
- Optional TOTP-based second factor and one-time recovery codes for account sign-in.
- Import/export and encrypted backup flows.
- Optional breach checks using Have I Been Pwned's k-anonymity range API.
- Optional integrations including Google Photo Cloud/Drive, GitHub, Telegram alerts, Brevo email, and Groq-powered diagnostics.
- API health/readiness endpoints and optional scheduler/keep-alive jobs.

Optional integrations require explicit configuration and their own provider credentials. A feature may be unavailable when the corresponding credentials are not configured.

### API server

- Entry point: `server/server.js`
- Express app and middleware: `server/app.js`
- MongoDB connection: `server/db/connection.js`
- API route registration: `server/router/routing.js`
- Server-side encryption helpers / legacy item handling: `server/models/EncDecManager.js`
- Security notes: [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)

The server reads `server/config.env` first, then the normal environment (including the hosting provider's environment variables). The checked-in template is `server/config.env.example`.

### Web client

- Source: `client/src/`
- API client: `client/src/api/client.js`
- Local development server: Vite
- Build output: `client/build/`

The API base URL can be configured at build time using `VITE_API_URLS` (comma-separated). The client also contains a default API endpoint, so do not assume an unset variable means it makes no network requests.

### Android client

- Source: `mobile/src/`
- API client: `mobile/src/lib/api.js`
- App configuration: `mobile/app.json`
- Expo configuration can provide fallback API server URLs. The client supports `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URLS` (comma-separated).

Only use public client variables for non-secret configuration. Anything with an `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix may be embedded into the app bundle and must not contain credentials.

## Technology

| Area | Main tools |
| --- | --- |
| API | Node.js 20+, Express 5, Mongoose, MongoDB, dotenv, Helmet, bcrypt, JWT |
| Web | React, React DOM, Vite, React Router, Axios |
| Android | Expo SDK, Expo Router, React Native, SecureStore, native crypto |
| Tests | Node test runner, Supertest, MongoDB Memory Server |
| Hosting | Render Blueprint in `render.yaml` |

Refer to each package manifest for the precise dependency versions and scripts.

## Requirements

- Git
- Node.js 20 or newer for the API; Node.js 20.19 or newer for the web client's current Vite toolchain
- npm
- A MongoDB deployment for persistent local use (local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas)
- Android Studio / Android SDK and JDK compatible with the installed Expo/React Native toolchain for native Android builds
- Expo/EAS access only if you intend to build through EAS

Use a supported Node.js LTS release and install the Android tooling according to current Expo documentation.

## Local setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tanushh18/password-manager.git
cd password-manager
```

### 2. Configure the API server

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp config.env.example config.env
```

On Windows PowerShell, use:

```powershell
Copy-Item config.env.example config.env
```

Edit `server/config.env` with a local MongoDB connection string and unique secrets. Generate strong independent random values:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"
```

Run the command twice; use one output for `SECRET_KEY` and the other for `CRYPTO_SECRET_KEY`. Never use the sample strings from the template in a deployed environment.

Start the API:

```bash
npm run dev:start
# or
npm start
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:8000` by default. Health endpoints include `/health`, `/livez`, and `/readyz`. Readiness requires a connected database.

### 3. Start the web client

Open another terminal from the repository root:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create `client/.env.local` if you want to override the default API address:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URLS=http://localhost:8000
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite prints the local URL. If the server URL is changed, restart Vite so the updated build-time environment is read.

### 4. Start the Android app

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

For an emulator/device using a locally running API, set the API URL to an address reachable from that device:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URLS=http://YOUR_LAN_IP:8000 npx expo run:android
```

For Android Emulator, the host machine is commonly reachable at `10.0.2.2`; for a physical device, use your computer's LAN IP and ensure the firewall permits the connection. Do not use `localhost` from a physical device to refer to your development computer.

The native build uses native modules; Expo Go alone may not support the complete app.

### 5. Configure optional providers

Enable only the integrations you plan to use. Typical secrets/configuration include:

- Google OAuth client ID/secret and the exact registered callback URI for Photo Cloud.
- Brevo API key plus a verified sender email for password-reset email.
- A random scheduler secret for a trusted monitor that calls the protected operations endpoint.
- Optional Groq key for diagnostics when enabled and consented to.
- Optional photo worker URLs and a shared worker secret for trusted worker instances.
- A GitHub token or Telegram bot token may be entered by an authenticated user in the app. These are user-provided integration credentials, not values that belong in the repository.

Store production credentials in the hosting platform's secret/environment settings, not in source control or in the web/mobile build environment.

## Environment variables

The canonical API template is `server/config.env.example`. The core values are:

| Variable | Required? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MONGO_URL` | Yes for persistent API data | MongoDB connection string. `DATABASE` and `MONGODB_URI` are also accepted aliases by the connection helper. |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Required by authentication/session features | JWT/authentication signing secret. |
| `CRYPTO_SECRET_KEY` | Required by server-side encrypted features | Protects server-held encryption keys and legacy/server-readable secrets. Keep it stable and separate from `SECRET_KEY`. |
| `PORT` | No | API port; defaults to `8000`. |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | Runtime mode. Set to `production` in deployment. |
| `CLIENT_ORIGINS` | No | Comma-separated allowed web origins. |
| `EXTENSION_ORIGINS` | No | Comma-separated exact Chrome extension origins. |
| `SELF_URL` | No | Public API URL used by keep-alive and callbacks. Render can provide `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL`. |
| `KEEP_ALIVE`, `KEEP_ALIVE_MINUTES` | No | Configure optional periodic self-ping. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Optional | Google OAuth configuration for Photo Cloud. |
| `GOOGLE_PHOTO_REDIRECT_URI` | Optional | Exact Google OAuth callback URL. |
| `PHOTO_CLOUD_CLIENT_URL` | Optional | Web client URL used by Photo Cloud redirect flows. |
| `RENDER_MONITOR_CRON_SECRET` | Optional | Shared secret for a trusted monitoring scheduler. |
| `BREVO_API_KEY`, `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL`, `BREVO_SENDER_NAME` | Optional | Transactional mail configuration. Configure a verified sender in Brevo. |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROQ_MODEL` | Optional | Optional AI-assisted diagnostics. |
| `PHOTO_WORKER_URLS`, `PHOTO_WORKER_SECRET` | Optional | Trusted photo worker fleet. |
| `PHOTO_IMPORT_WORKER`, `PHOTO_IMPORT_PARALLEL` | Optional | Photo import worker behavior. |

Check code and provider settings before adding more variables: integrations evolve. Never copy real production values into this table or into `.env.example`.

## Run tests and builds

### API tests

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

### Web tests, lint, and production build

```bash
cd client
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### Android tooling

```bash
cd mobile
npm run doctor
```

Build an APK or Play Store bundle using EAS:

```bash
npm run build:apk
npm run build:aab
```

EAS account access and any required build secrets must be configured outside the repository. Test commands/builds were not run as part of this documentation change.

## Deployment

The root `render.yaml` describes a static web service rooted at `client/` and a Node web service rooted at `server/`.

1. Create/select the Render Blueprint for this repository.
2. Configure all required server environment variables in Render's Environment settings.
3. Configure `VITE_API_URLS` as a build-time setting for the static client.
4. Set `CLIENT_ORIGINS` to the exact deployed site origin(s); avoid broad CORS allowlists.
5. Use the same database and matching auth/encryption secrets across API instances that share a database.
6. Set the trusted monitoring secret only if an external scheduler is configured to use it.
7. Deploy and verify `/health` and `/readyz`.

Do not put secret values into `render.yaml`. The Blueprint should contain variable names and non-sensitive defaults only.

## Security and privacy notes

### Encryption claims

The repository contains multiple generations of encryption behavior. Newer client code and `docs/SECURITY.md` describe device-side PBKDF2 and AES-GCM for vault entries, while server code also contains server-side encryption helpers for legacy entries and features such as TOTP. The root README has historically described a different current model. Review code paths before making any claim that every data type is end-to-end encrypted or zero-knowledge.

At minimum:

- Treat `CRYPTO_SECRET_KEY` and the database as high-value secrets.
- Do not log passwords, tokens, cookies, request bodies, recovery codes, or decrypted vault contents.
- Keep HTTPS enabled in production.
- Use unique high-entropy secrets and a least-privilege database user.
- Use two-factor authentication on source-control and deployment accounts.
- Exported CSVs and decrypted backups are plaintext and must be stored securely and deleted when no longer required.
- Third-party integrations may send metadata to their providers. Review each integration before enabling it.
- No master-password recovery may be possible for vault data encrypted solely by a locally-derived key; maintain encrypted backups securely.

### If a credential has ever been committed

Deleting it from the current file is not sufficient. Assume it may remain accessible through Git history, forks, caches, or artifacts. Revoke/rotate the credential with its provider first, then remove the exposed value and consider history cleanup. Never paste a credential into an issue or chat when asking for help.

## Repository hygiene

- Keep local `config.env`, `.env`, provider credentials, private keys, database dumps, recovery scripts and plaintext exports out of Git.
- Use `server/config.env.example` as a template only; its values must be placeholders, never valid credentials.
- Only expose `VITE_*` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables when they are safe for every user of the built client.
- Do not commit production account data, logs, screenshots containing secrets, cloud service-account JSON, or copied database records.
- Before sharing the repo, inspect recent commits and Git history with secret scanning. GitHub secret scanning may not detect every private or custom credential pattern.

## Troubleshooting

**API says no database URL is configured**
- Set `MONGO_URL` in `server/config.env` or the server environment and check that the DB accepts connections.

**Login/session failures across server instances**
- Ensure all instances sharing a database use the same auth/encryption environment values, and check cookie/CORS settings for the deployed site.

**Web app calls the wrong API**
- Set `VITE_API_URLS` and rebuild/restart Vite. Check the configured API fallback in `client/src/api/client.js`.

**Android app cannot reach a local server**
- Use a reachable LAN IP or emulator host alias, not the phone's own `localhost`.

**Password-reset email is not sent**
- Configure a valid Brevo API key and sender verified with Brevo in the server environment.
