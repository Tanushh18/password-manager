        <h2>What you get</h2>
        <ul>{FEATURES.map((f) => <li key={f}>{f}</li>)}</ul>
        <h2>How to install</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Open this page on your Android phone and tap <strong>Download APK</strong>.</li>
          <li>Open the downloaded file. If Android asks, allow installs from your browser.</li>
          <li>Open Stashr, sign in, and turn on photo backup in the Photos tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="apps__note">Updates install over the old app and keep your data. If a previous build refuses to update, uninstall it first.</p>
        <h2>Stashr Hub for Android</h2>
        <p>The app for the always-on home tablet (and, in phone mode, a phone that reports its health). It joins with a code, so nobody types your Stashr password on it.</p>
        <a className="btn btn--primary apps__download" href={HUB_APK} download="stashr-hub.apk">Download Stashr Hub</a>
        <h3>On the home tablet</h3>

          <li>Type the 8-letter code in Stashr Hub. The tablet asks for camera, microphone and notification permission once.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Stashr TV for Android TV</h2>
        <p>The launcher for the living-room TV. It replaces the old TV app: home screen, movie sync from Google Drive to a USB drive, a player, remote control from Stashr and on-screen messages.</p>
        <a className="btn btn--primary apps__download" href={TV_APK} download="stashr-tv.apk">Download Stashr TV</a>

          <li>On the website open <strong>Smart home → Devices → Link the home tablet or TV</strong> and copy the code.</li>
          <li>Open Stashr TV, type the code and a name for the TV, and choose it as the home app when Android asks.</li>
          <li>In Stashr TV’s settings turn on the “Stashr TV remote” accessibility service and “Display over other apps”, so Home/Back commands and on-screen messages work.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="apps__note">Plug in a USB drive for movies. Stashr TV updates itself from GitHub releases; Android asks for one tap.</p>
        <h2>Stashr Cast for Android</h2>
        <p>Show your phone on the TV. It is a separate small app, so it never touches your Stashr data.</p>
        <a className="btn btn--primary apps__download" href={CAST_APK} download="stashr-cast.apk">Download Stashr Cast</a>
        <ul>{CAST.map((f) => <li key={f}>{f}</li>)}</ul>

          <li>On the TV open Stashr TV → <strong>Screen mirror</strong>; it shows a 4-digit PIN.</li>
          <li>On the phone open Stashr Cast, pick the TV, type the PIN and tap <strong>Start mirroring</strong>.</li>
          <li>Allow the screen-capture question. Tap Stop in the notification (or press Back on the TV) to end.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="apps__note">Phone and TV on the same Wi-Fi, ideally 5 GHz. iPhones can’t use this app; they use AirPlay or the TV’s built-in Cast.</p>
        <h2>Stashr Location for Android</h2>
        <p>A tiny app for the phones of people at home. It only shares where the phone is, so the family never gets near your passwords. Install it on each family phone.</p>
        <a className="btn btn--primary apps__download" href={WHERE_APK} download="stashr-location.apk">Download Stashr Location</a>
        <ul>{WHERE.map((f) => <li key={f}>{f}</li>)}</ul>
        <ol>
          <li>On the website open <strong>Smart home → Devices → Family locations</strong>. The link code is there, and it stays the same until you make a new one.</li>
          <li>Install the APK on the family phone. If Android asks, allow installs from your browser.</li>
          <li>Open Stashr Location, type the code and the person’s name, and tap <strong>Connect</strong>. Allow location “all the time” when it asks.</li>
          <li>Set the home location once on the website (Smart home → Automations → Places). It applies to every phone.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="apps__note">On some phones (Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo) battery savers pause background apps. If updates stop, the app has a button for its battery settings. It updates itself from GitHub releases; Android asks for one tap.</p>
        <h2>Browser extension</h2>
        <p>Autofill from your vault in Chrome, Edge and Brave. Version {EXT.version}.</p>
